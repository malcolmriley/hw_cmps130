If $ A $ has $ a $ elements and $ B $ has $ b $ elements, then, $ A \times B $ has $ a * b $ elements. This is because the cartesian product of two sets is a set of $2$-tuples consisting of paired elements of both sets; the number of unique pairs of elements that can be created from two sets is the product of the number of elements in each set.
