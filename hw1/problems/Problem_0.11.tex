The error in this proof is that the assumption that the set $ H $ (of $ k + 1 $ horses) are all the same color does not follow from the stated base case, a set with $1$ horse. While it is true that removing one horse from a set of two horses will yield a set of horses of all the same color (as there is only one horse in the remaining set), the implicit assumption is that the colors of all horses in sets of two are always the same (which has not been demonstrated).
