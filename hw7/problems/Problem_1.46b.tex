It must be demonstrated that the language $L = \{ \str{0}^m\str{1}^n \mid m \neq n \}$ is not regular.
\begin{proof}
The Myhill-Nerode Theorem will be used to demonstrate that $L$ is not regular.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
		\item 
	\end{enumerate}
	Therefore the index of $L$ is infinite and as such $L$ is not regular as required.
\end{proof}
