$\varnothing$: Let $P = \varnothing$. The set of production rules is empty, thus no strings will be produced. \par
Alternatively: \par
\begin{tabular}{ccl}
	$R$ & $\rightarrow$ & $R$ \\
\end{tabular} \par
Since no \emph{finite} strings are produced in a \emph{finite} number of steps, the above production rule results in the empty set.
